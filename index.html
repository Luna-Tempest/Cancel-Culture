    <p class= "paragraph">Cancel Culture, according to <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cancel-culture">Dictionary.com</a> means the phenomenon or practice of publicly rejecting, boycotting, or ending support for particular people or groups because of their socially or morally unacceptable views or actions. This phenomenon started around the 2010s and early 2020s. 
    Initially, the main goal of Cancel Culture was to hold people accountable when the justice system failed. 
    However, with the popularization of this action as a form of online social organization to draw attention to social causes, it has also become a tool for public humiliation, affecting not only celebrities but also ordinary people's lives. </p>
      
    <p class= "paragraph">The main impact of canceling someone on the internet is: THERE IS NO MERCY. This means that even if the person issues a public apology, their image is damaged foreverâ€”no redemption arc or dialogue. It's a fact that we are all human and, by nature, make mistakes and learn from them. 
    However, nowadays, especially for public figures, a mistake or misunderstanding can destroy years of hard work, and they might never recover. </p>

    <p class= "paragraph" id= "cancellers-text">The issue starts when you not allow the other to learn from their mistakes, when there's no supportive or emphatetic action even after an apologize. The thing is, mostly of the "cancellers" think that what they 're doing is right even if there is no factual comproval, which means people can have their reputation destroyed from a rumor. Even though the intention is look for justice it does not justify all the harm and damage tha this culture create. </p>
